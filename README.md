Assignment 1 - Linear Regression 
The assignment includes the code implementating the linear regression from scratch and I have also implemented various basis functions to fit the line.
I also implemented the locally weighted linear regression to attain more accuracy and understood the feature importance by executing the assignment.
Files need to be uploaded with the code in the session storage, the same file names given by the Professor.
